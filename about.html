<!-- About TEDxDesignTechHighSchool Text -->
<div class="abouttedxdths">
<center><h1>About <strong id="tedx">TEDxDesignTechHighSchool</strong></h1></center>
<center><p>TEDxDesignTechHighSchool is an independently organized, student-run TED event. It occurs at the end of each academic year at the Oracle Conference Center. Our hope is that the event will continue to be renewed and done annually.</p></center>
<center><p>Design Tech High School was founded with the mission to develop students who believe that the world can be a better place and that they can be the ones to make that happen. Because of this we aim to create an environment where d.tech students who are driven and passionate about their disciplines and ideas can showcase the talents that our diverse campus has to offer, and can have a place where their “ideas can spread”. This event is a life-changing experience for everyone, from the audience members to the d.tech staff.

<!-- About TED/TEDx Text -->
<div class="AboutTEDx">
<center><h1>About <strong id="tedx">TED</strong> and <strong id="tedx">TEDx</strong></h1></center>
<center><p><a href="https://ted.com">TED</a> is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. </p></center>

<center><p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called <a href="https://ted.com/tedx">TEDx</a>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxDesignTechHighSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxDesignTechHighSchool events, TED Talk videos and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p></center>
