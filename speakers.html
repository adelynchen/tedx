<h3><em>Student at Design Tech High School</em></h3>
<p>I was born in Fresno and have lived in California for my entire life.

My personal interests include: sci-fi, politics, writing, technology, and philosophy.</p>

<h2>Sam Mendelson</h2>
<h3><em>Student at Design Tech High School</em></h3>
<p>Sam’s passion for computers began the summer in Paris when he was three years old, right after he taught himself to read. With unrestricted access to a PC with a fast internet connexion, he started to Google. This interest continued through grade school, where he readily assisted teachers with technology. During the same period of time, he furthered his interest by white hat hacking— for good— both at school and at home.
